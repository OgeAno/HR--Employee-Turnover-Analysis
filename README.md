# HR-Employee-Turnover-Analysis
**An Analysis of Employee Turnover using SQL.**
Using 3 related public Human Resources datasets, I performed an analysis of employee turnover for a given 12 month period. The datasets contain information about employee personal details, and their job details. For data preparation, I used MySQL. The Jupyter Notebook shows the data wrangling steps I took using MySQL. After I was done with data wrangling, I exported the cleaned dataset to Tableau for visualisation.
