# HR-Employee-Turnover-Analysis
### Data Manipulation Using SQL        
Using 3 related public Human Resources datasets, I performed an analysis of employee turnover for a given 12 month period. The datasets contain information about employee personal details, and their job details. For data preparation, I used MySQL. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://ogeano.github.io/HR--Employee-Turnover-Analysis/) shows the data wrangling steps I took using MySQL. After I was done with data wrangling, I exported the cleaned dataset to Tableau for visualisation.
