# HR-Employee-Turnover-Analysis
**An analysis of employee turnover for a given 12-month period.**
Using 3 related public Human Resources datasets, I performed an analysis of employee turnover for the year 2015. The datasets contain information about employee personal details, and their job details. For my data prepration, I used MySQL for data wrangling. The Jupyter Notebook shows the data wrangling steps I took using MySQL.
