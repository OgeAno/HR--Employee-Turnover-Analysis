# HR-Employee-Turnover-Analysis
### Data Manipulation Using SQL        
Using 3 related public Human Resources datasets, I performed an analysis of employee turnover for a given 12 month period. The datasets contain information about employee personal details, and their job details. For data preparation, I used MySQL. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OgeAno/HR--Employee-Turnover-Analysis/blob/19a44c68476c941c31f42a30774dc84884a8b6fe/Employee_Turnover_Analysis.ipynb) shows the data wrangling steps I took using MySQL. After I was done with data wrangling, I exported the cleaned dataset to Tableau for visualisation.
